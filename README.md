# Ultrasonic Rover

#### This project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and an Arduino Nano microcontroller to create an obstacle-avoiding rover called **Cornelius**. Included are STL files for 3D printing, an LTspice schematic for wiring visualization, images, and a parts list. The project is divided into Mechanical, Electrical, and Programming sections for clarity. Although not a direct contributor, **Kaveh Zare** played an important role in refreshing my C++ skills, which helped make this project possible.

### Parts List:

- Arduino Nano
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor
- 2× TT DC gear motors
- L298N motor driver
- Micro servo (MG90 used; SG90 recommended)
- 2× 18650 Li-ion batteries (with holder)
- 470 µF electrolytic capacitor
- Breadboard
- Dupont jumper wires
- 3D-printed chassis and wheels (PLA)
- Zipties
- Screws, washers, nails (for wheel mounting)
- Electrical tape (for servo fitment)

### Mechanical:
The chassis is custom-designed, and the wheels are inspired by a design from Prof. Wolken at Irvine Valley College. The ultrasonic sensor bracket is not included in this repository. I recommend sourcing or designing one that best fits your build. Many suitable brackets can be found online (e.g., searching “HC-SR04 bracket” on Printables).
- **Printing:** Chassis and wheels were 3D printed with PLA.
- **Chassis Features:**
  - Holes for zipties to secure the motors and components
  - Holes for routing TT motor wires to the motor driver
  - Bracket for the servo motor (slightly loose—use tape or a small shim for tightness)
- **Wheels:**
  - Front wheels mounted to motors with zipties
  - Rear wheels attached via two nails through a mounting bracket
- **Component Mounting:** Breadboard, motor driver, and battery holder secured with tabs on the chassis
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Custom bracket (found online) reinforced with screws and washers for stability.
- **Servo Motor:** MG90 (metal gears, overkill for this project—an SG90 or similar plastic gear servo works fine)
- **Notes:** Some wheel wobbling may occur, especially during extended operation

#### Assembly on Onshape:

### Electrical:
The rover is powered by two 18650 LiPo batteries in series (nominal 3.7 V each, 7.4 V total).
- **Voltage Considerations:**
  - Arduino Nano VIN: 7–14 V
  - MG90 servo: up to 12 V
  - Actual battery voltage ~8 V. sufficient for this setup
- **Motors:** TT motors (3–6 V). voltage drop across the motor driver brings them into the safe range
- **Logic Power:**
  - Arduino Nano and L298N motor driver have built-in 5 V regulators
  - 5 V from Nano powers both the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and the MG90 servo
- **Capacitor:** 470 µF across power rail and GND smooths voltage spikes
- **Wiring:** Dupont jumper wires were used. Ensure solid connections to avoid intermittent
failures
- **Current Draw:** Realistically, total current should not exceed 2 A or get close.

### Programming: 
The code is functional but can be optimized to reduce load on the Nano. It uses multiple `.cpp` files with a header file.
- **Compilation:** Arduino CLI (Linux tested)
- **Arduino IDE:** Should also work, though you may need to include all files manually
- **Shell Script:** Provided (`run.sh`) to simplify execution. Ensure it has executable permissions (`chmod +x run.sh`)

### Movement Logic:

| Movement   | IN1 | IN2 | IN3 | IN4 | ENA | ENB |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Forward    | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | PWM | PWM |
| Backward   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | PWM | PWM |
| Turn Left  | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | PWM | PWM |
| Turn Right | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | PWM | PWM |
| Stop       | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

**0 = Low**\
**1 = High**\
**PWM = 0-255 (analog), LOW or HIGH (digital)**
